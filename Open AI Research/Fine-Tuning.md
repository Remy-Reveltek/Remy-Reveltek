# AI Fine-Tuning
AI fine-tuning refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained AI language model so that it can better perform a specific task. Here's a brief explanation of the different aspects of fine-tuning :

- **Temperature:** A hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the model's output. A high temperature makes the model more diverse, while a low temperature makes it more conservative.

- **Maximum length:** The maximum number of tokens the model can generate in one sequence.

- **Stop sequence:** A sequence of tokens that, when generated by the model, indicate the end of the output.

- **Top P:** A technique for controlling the diversity of the model's output. It involves choosing the most likely next tokens with a probability of at least P.

- **Frequency penalty:** A penalty applied to the likelihood of a token based on how frequently it appears in the training data.

- **Presence penalty:** A penalty applied to the likelihood of a token based on whether it has already been generated in the current sequence.

- **Best of:** A method for selecting the best output among several generated by the model.

- **Inject start text:** Adding a sequence of tokens to the beginning of the input before generating output.

- **Inject restart text:** Adding a sequence of tokens to the beginning of the input and clearing the model's internal state before generating output.

- **Show probabilities:** Displaying the probability assigned to each generated token by the model.
